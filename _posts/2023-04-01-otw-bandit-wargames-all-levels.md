OverTheWire Bandit Wargames is designed like a Capture the Flag or (CTF) game where we have to capture each flag or password to proceed to the next level.
This makes it very enjoyable and learning a lot of tools and tricks of various basic Linux Concepts.

>This writeup will be heavily **hint** focused, but we will also be disclosing each command to get the job done for each level.

If you are able to understand Nepali Language, then perhaps you could also enjoy the YouTube Series that I have made for this topic going in Depth in each of the Levels, this I would highly recommend for any beginners who want to learn Linux.Â 

## Recommended Path:
Start by trying to *play this game on your own.* We will be providing the solution part for each level at the end, try to solve it on your own first and follow the various hints and references.

We will be using the following structure for each level
1. What is the Level about.
2. Hints on how we can solve this challenge:
3. Actual solution which needs to be clicked to be seen.
